## Loops
there is only for loop in Go
there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces {} are always required.

The init and post statements are optional.

FOREVER - If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.
```
func main() {
	for {
	}
}
```
